## 📖 Overview

Stroke is one of the leading causes of speech impairment among adults, significantly affecting communication and quality of life. Traditional speech therapy often requires regular hospital visits, making rehabilitation difficult for many patients.

**Post-Stroke Speech Therapy** is an AI-powered Flutter application that enables stroke survivors to practice speech exercises independently while allowing therapists to monitor patient progress remotely. The application leverages TensorFlow Lite for on-device AI inference, Firebase for cloud services, and speech recognition technologies to provide real-time pronunciation and fluency feedback.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Improve speech rehabilitation for post-stroke patients.
- Provide personalized speech therapy sessions.
- Evaluate pronunciation and fluency using Artificial Intelligence.
- Track rehabilitation progress through detailed reports.
- Enable therapists to assign and monitor therapy sessions remotely.
